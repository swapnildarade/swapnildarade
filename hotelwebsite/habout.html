          <h5>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.

          Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
           Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: 
           hunting and gathering and agriculture. As agricultural technologies increased, 
           humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography.
            Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts,
             including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques,
              and dishes. As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, 
              ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of
               different food traditions and practices.
